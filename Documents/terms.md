The documents contain several terms that share the same meaning, such as `object`, `sprites`, and `game object` (or `gameObject`).
These terms refer to the same concept. However, terms like prefabrication or UI have distinct meanings and should not be 
confused with the terms above.

However, `object` as a structure, `mesh` as a structure, and `sprite` as a class have different meanings. Also, there is no class named `gameObject`.
